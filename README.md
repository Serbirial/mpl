## MPL
[YOU NEED TO HAVE VLC INSTALLED](https://www.videolan.org/index.html)

There will be more updates soon, i am currently working on a spotify library, and a last.fm wrapper, which i will implement into this.

# Using
* add songs `~/Music`
* import mpl after installing, or alternatively, you can run `player.py` directly with python
* once you launch, it will tell you what do do
